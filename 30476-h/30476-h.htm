<h1><span class="sp1">ZERO HOUR</span></h1>

<h2><i>by<br />
Alexander Blade</i></h2>

<div class="bk1"><p><big><b>By accident Bobby discovered the rocket was
about to be shot to the Moon. Naturally he wanted
to go along. But could he smuggle himself aboard?</b></big></p></div>

<div class="bk1"><b>Illustrated by Lloyd Rognan</b></div>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Dad had</span> already gone when
Bobby got up. This disappointed
Bobby a little but
then he remembered&mdash;<i>this was the
big day</i>. Naturally Dad would get
over to the project early. And at
four o'clock&mdash; Bobby shivered deliciously
at the thought of it.</p>

<p>He ate his breakfast in silence
with Mom across the table drinking
a cup of coffee and looking at a
fashion catalogue. He was glad she
was occupied because he didn't want
to talk; not today he didn't. Might
spill something secret. Might even
let out the <i>big secret</i>. That would
be terrible.</p>

<p>Of course, all things were secret
at Buffalo Flats. So secret top
scientists like Dad didn't even discuss
them with wives like Mom.
And wives like Mom never asked.</p>

<p>So it was really something to sit
there eating breakfast knowing that,
today, Dad was going to rocket to
the Moon. And with Mom not even
knowing the Lunar project was in
the works, so naturally not dreaming
that he was going <i>with</i> Dad!
The thrill was overpowering.</p>

<p>Maybe they would have radio
communication after they got
there and he would call back and
say, <i>Hello, Mom! Guess where I
am? On the moon with Dad!</i> And
Mom would say, <i>Why, Bobby!
Scaring me to death like this! I
was looking all over for you.</i> Sounding
very angry but not being really
angry after all. Because maybe
Dad would cut in and say, <i>Yeah,
he's right here with me, dear. What
do you think of this boy of ours?</i></p>

<p>Bobby gulped the last of his
cereal so he could go outside and
wriggle for joy. As he got up from
his chair, Mom said, "And what's
your plan for today, young man?
Davy Crockett or Buck Rogers?"</p>

<div class="figr"><img src="images/001.png" width="362" height="500" alt="" title="" /></div>

<p>Bobby had a quick thought&mdash;a
sudden temptation. Why not give
Mom a hint? Why he could even
<i>tell</i> her and she still wouldn't know.
Then later, after he was gone, she
would remember back and say,
<i>That boy! When he tells you something
he really means it.</i></p>

<p>Bobby smiled and said, "I think
I'll go to the moon today."</p>

<p>Mom smiled too and went back
to her fashions. "Well, see to it
your fuel mixture is correct."</p>

<p>"I'll check it. And Mom&mdash;I
might not be home for lunch."</p>

<p>"Where will you be?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know."</p>

<p>"Well, mind your manners and
say thank you when you leave."</p>

<p>Mrs. Kendall, still smiling,
watched Bobby dash out into the
yard. Living on a restricted government
area had one compensation at
least. You didn't have to worry
about your children. Four dozen
families, all with offspring, trapped
behind ten-foot patrolled fence.
Here, nobody worried about their
children. They came and went and
at noon a mother fed whatever
number happened to be in the house
at the time. Mrs. Kendall usually
drew six or seven. It would be a
relief to dodge the chore for one
Saturday....</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Out in the</span> backyard, Bobby
fussed around his space rocket
a little: tightening a screw here&mdash;hammering
in a nail there. Just
until he could slip away without
Mom noticing his direction.</p>

<p>It wasn't a bad rocket at that,
he thought. Six feet long with two
seats and a keen instrument panel.
But kid stuff of course. After he
found the way in through the sewer
he hadn't paid any more attention
to his own ship.</p>

<p>He could see Mom through the
window, back in her book, so he
went casually out through the back
gate and turned left, kicking at
pebbles as he sauntered along and
trying to look as though he had no
place to go. Had to be careful.
Didn't want to bump into any of
the other kids today, either.</p>

<p>The way in through the sewer
was at a place behind Laboratory
B. There was a kind of an alley
there that nobody ever walked
through and then this round lid
you could lift up and look under.
And a ladder you could climb
down.</p>

<p>Bobby hadn't dared go down at
first. But, after thinking about it
overnight, his curiosity won out
and he went back and ducked down
into the lower level. He called it
a sewer because of sewers being
underground, but this place was
clean and had bunches of wires
strung in every direction and faint
little lights you could see by.</p>

<p>Bobby went further and further
every trip he took, never telling
anybody because you weren't supposed
to talk about things at Buffalo
Flats&mdash;not even to the other
kids.</p>

<p>Then he found the big drome
where they were building the rocket.
It was so sleek and beautiful
and shiny that he just stared at it&mdash;up
through the grating in the
floor that was for air circulation
or something.</p>

<p>He didn't know it was the moon
rocket at first. Not until he'd gone
back several times to peek up at
it and then one day two scientists
came walking along right in front
of his nose.</p>

<p>One of them was Dad.</p>

<p>Bobby almost called out but he
caught himself and just listened to
them talking. This was the first
time his conscience bothered him
about going underneath the drome.
He thought about it a lot&mdash;whether
it was the right thing to do. And
while he was never able to still his
conscience completely, he quieted
down by saying he really wasn't
doing any harm because he'd never
told anybody what he saw.</p>

<p>He learned the rocket was going
to the moon by listening to Dad
and the other scientists talk when
they thought they were alone. And
it was funny. Because even there,
they spoke in low voices and didn't
give too much away.</p>

<p>He had known now for three
days that at four o'clock the roof
would open and the drome would
be turned into a blast-pit and the
rocket would shoot out through
space to the moon.</p>

<p>That was all he <i>did</i> know for
sure. None of the men had said who
was going on the first trip to the
moon. Nothing had been said on
that subject at all, but Bobby
knew Dad would go. He would have
to. After all, Dad was the second
biggest scientist at Buffalo Flats.
Second only to Schleimmer himself
and Professor Schleimmer was
very old and certainly wouldn't
make the trip. That left Dad. Dad
would just have to go in order to
run the rocket. There probably
wasn't anybody else smart enough
in the whole place.</p>

<p>The idea of going himself had
been born the previous day&mdash;when
he found a larger grating in the
floor near the rocket and realized
if he was very careful he could
climb out of the sewer and duck
into the rocket when nobody was
looking. Once inside he was pretty
sure he'd find a place to hide until
blast-off.</p>

<p>All the men would probably be
strapped in bunks but if he found
a place he could wedge himself in
he didn't think he'd get hurt. Then,
halfway to the moon he would come
out and find Dad and would he
be surprised!</p>

<p>At first, thinking about it, he'd
been scared but after he realized
how proud Dad and Mom would
be, he made up his mind.</p>

<p>Now, crouched beside the
grating near the ship, he waited
while two men&mdash;technicians in
white overalls&mdash;walked by.</p>

<p>One of them said, "Well, whatever
happens, she'll make a big
splash."</p>

<p>"You said it. Hope the brains
know what they're doing."</p>

<p>That made Bobby mad. Who
said Dad didn't know what he was
doing? Dad was just about the
smartest scientist in the world.</p>

<p>After the two men left he waited
a long time. He heard voices but
no one came in sight. Taking a
deep breath, he opened the grating
and got out. It was only four
steps to the open port of the rocket.
There was a little ramp they'd
used to roll things in and Bobby's
feet touched it but lightly as he
jumped into the ship. He found
himself in some kind of a storeroom.
It would be a good place to
hide all right. It was full of aluminum
barrels all the same size. He
found a space between two rows and
sat down and got his breath back.
It was very quiet around him.
Scary quiet. But he set his lips
firmly.</p>

<p>He was going to the moon with
Dad.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">John Kendall</span> was a little
late that night. He kissed his
wife and said, "Well, did you see
the big sky rocket?"</p>

<p>"How could I miss it, darling?
Your supper is in the oven."</p>

<p>"I could use a Martini first."</p>

<p>"Coming right up."</p>

<p>While Myra fixed the drink
John lay back in his easy chair
and closed his eyes. "We'd hoped to
stage a little ceremony at the
launching but Washington said
no."</p>

<p>"The Russians?"</p>

<p>"The Eastern Coalition. It was a
race. That was why it had to be
so secret. Washington said, light
the fuse and fire the thing."</p>

<p>"Is it still hush-hush?"</p>

<p>"No. Not between us at least.
We fired an explosion rocket at the
moon. It will hit in about an hour
and telescopes will show a big purple
spot when our explosives go
off and throw dye all over the
place."</p>

<p>Myra handed him a dry Martini.
"I see. Lots of fun no doubt but
what's the purpose? Fourth of
July on the moon?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no. If the experiment is a
success the next rocket will carry
men instead of a bomb."</p>

<p>Myra went to the kitchen to see
about supper. John called, "Where's
Bobby? In bed I suppose."</p>

<p>Myra didn't hear and John set
his drink down and moved toward
the bedroom. Maybe he was still
awake.</p>

<p>Bobby rolled over. His eyes
popped open. "Dad! I thought you
went to&mdash;"</p>

<p>John Kendall sat down on the
edge of the bed and tousled his
son's hair. "No, son. It's the old
<i>terra firma</i> for me. Did you see
the rocket blast?"</p>

<p>"Uh-huh. It was really something.
It went to the moon, didn't
it?"</p>

<p>"That's right." Kendall smiled
and thought. Try to keep a secret
from the kids. It just can't be
done. "How's <i>your</i> moon rocket
coming along, son?"</p>

<p>"Pretty good. Gee, Dad! As long
as you didn't go, I'm glad I didn't
go either."</p>

<p>"You were planning to make
the trip also?"</p>

<p>"Uh-huh. I got into the rocket
and was all set but I got to thinking
about Mom&mdash;how one of us
should stay and take care of her
in case anything happened."</p>

<p>"Smart thinking, son. Now you
get to sleep. I'll have a little time
tomorrow. We'll play some ball."</p>

<p>"That will be keen!"</p>

<p>John Kendall smiled as he left
the bedroom. Kids were wonderful!
Give them a few old boards and
a steering wheel and they could
build a ship to fly to the moon.
What a wonderful dream world
they lived in!</p>

<p>Too bad they had to grow out
of it.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
